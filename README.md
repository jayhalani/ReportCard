# ReportCard
This is the fifth project I've submitted to Udacity for the Android Basics NanoDegree. The main criteria of the Project is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Java Class which would allow a school to store a studentâ€™s grades for a particular year. This project was just a java class, rather than a full Android app.
